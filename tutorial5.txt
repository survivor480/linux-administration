To view the ip address, we can view it in ifconfig
We can also view the ip address using the ip address show
It can also be seen by ip addr show or ip a show
All of them work the same.
We can also omit the show command because it is the default behaviour of the command.
ip a also works the same as the others

To view the ipv4 address, we can have a look at ip -4 address
To view the ipv6 address, we can have a look at ip -6 address

We can view the details of a specific interface by the following command
ifconfig enp0s3
ip addr show dev enp0s3

Both work the same
Short form of the second one is ip a s dev enp0s3

To set an interface down, ip link set enp0s3 down.

We can configure the ip of the particular interface, 
ifconfig enp0s3 192.168.0.111/24 up

To remove the existing details of an interface,
ip address del 192.168.0.111/24 dev enp0s3
To add the new details in the interface
ip address add 192.168.0.222/24 dev enp0s3

The route -n shows the default gateways for the different interfaces.
To add a new default gateway for the interfaces, we can do the following procedure
ip route show
This shows the routes and the default configuration.
To delete the default configuration ip route del default.
To add the default configuration again, ip route add default via 192.168.0.1

To change the mac address of the interface, 
ifconfig enp0s3 down
ifconfig enp0s3 hw ether 08:00:27:51:05:09
ifconfig enp0s3 up

To change it by avoiding so many commands,
ip link set dev enp0s3 address 08:00:27:51:05:01
