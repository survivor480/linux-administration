To view the file permissions, run the ls -l command.

We get the output as such
-rw-r--r--  1   root    root    2972    Aug 2   14:38   /etc/passwd
The first triplet represents the owner permissions, the second triplet represents the group permissions,
and the last triplet is everyone's permission.

To remove the read permissions for the specific user, 
chmod u-r users.txt
To remove the write permission as well,
chmod u-w users.txt

Now, chmod 000 interfaces.txt actually removes the permissions for each one of them. It replaces all the
permissions with dashes. But if we write with root, we are allowed to write with the help of root. If we try
to read with root, we can read it.

The file read and write permissions are only for non-privileged users.

Changing File Permissions (chmod)

chmod is the command used to change the permissions of a file or a directory using
either the symbolic or the numeric notation.
Only the root, or the file's owner, can change the file's permissions
chmod who|[OPERATION][permissions] filename


Changing File Permissions (chmod)

chmod who|[OPERATION]Ipermissions] filename
who signifies the user category whose permissions will be changed.
u: the user that owns the file.
g: the group that the file belongs to.
o: the other users.
The OPERATION flags define whether the permissions are to be removed, added, or set:
a hyphen means remove the specified permissions.
+the plus sign means Add the specified permissions.
equals means change the current permissions to the specified permissions.
The permissions are specified using the letters r, w and x.


To change the permissions for all the fields, we can execute the following command.

chmod u-x, g+x, o-rwx user.txt

To execute something that is valid for all ie users, groups and others as well, we can use
the letter a.

chmod a+r, a-wx, user.txt

Another way to change the permissions is chmod ug=rw, o= user.txt 

To have the same permissions as that of another file, we can run the following command,
ls -l i.txt user.txt

We can change the directory permissions as well. We will only be able to read the contents of the file in case we can only
read it using the ls command.
In case of directories, if the execute permission is not set, the write permission has no effect.

The permissions of the parent directory are more important than that of the file.

Changing the permissions of all the files in the directory to 640, the command for this is
find ~ -type f -exec chmod 640 {} \;

Changing the permissions of all the directories in a directory to 750, the command for this is
find ~ -type d -exec chmod 750 {} \;

lscpu lists all the information about the CPU.

Changing the owner of the file, we can run sudo chown toor cpu.txt.

To change the owner using the userid, sudo chown +1005 cpu.txt

To change the group, we can use

sudo chgrp :sudo cpu.txt

Special Permissions - SUID (Set User D)

Besides r, w and x for the owner, group and others there are 3 extra special permissions
for each file or directory: SUID or Set User ID, SGID or Set Group ID and Sticky Bit.
These special permissions are for a file or directory overall, not just for a user category.
When an executable file with SUID is executed then the resulting process will have the
permissions of the owner of the command, not the permissions of the user who
executes the command.
Setting SUID:
Absolute Mode: chmod 4XXX file
Relative Mode: chmod u+s file
Is-I/usr/bin/passwd
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 68208 apr 16 15:36 /usr/bin/passwd

To add the suid permission, we can use sudo chmod u+s /usr/bin/cat

To find the files or directories with a particular permission, we can use
find /usr/bin/ -perm -4000


Special Permissions - SGID (Set Group ID)

SGID is set mainly to directories.
If you set SGID on directories, all files or directories created inside that directory will be
owned by the same group owner of the directory where SGID was configured.
This is useful in creating shared directories, which are directories that are writable at
the group level.
Setting SGID:
Absolute Mode: chmod 2XXX directory
.Relative Mode: chmod g+s directory
Is -Id /programming/
drwxrws-2 pr1 programmers 4096 iul 14 13:15 /programming/


We can change the owner and the group by the following command

chown pr1:programmers /programming/

To activate the SGID bit for the directories, 

chmod 2770 /programming/

This is how we activate the sgid bit.
We can also acheive the same by
chmod g+s /programming/

Special Permissions The Sticky Bit

The Sticky Bit is applied to directories.
A user may only delete files that he owns or for which he has explicit write permission
granted, even when he has write access to the directory.
The sticky bit allows you to create a directory that everyone can use as a shared file
storage. The files are protected because, no one can delete anyone else's files.
Setting the sticky bit:
Absolute Mode: chmod 1XXX directory
Relative Mode: chmod ott directory
Is -Id /temp/
drwxrwxrwt 2 root root 4096 iul 14 13:45 /temp/


To activate the sticky bit, we would have to prepend 1 to the already existing permissions.

chmod 1777 /temp/
chmod o+t /temp/

If we attach the sticky bit, then another non-privileged user cannot delete the files in the ownership
of another non-privileged user.

It is considered that the default permissions for the file upon creation is 0666 for files and 0777 for directories.

Executing umask command in the cli, we get the value as 0002.

Now the default value for the permissions of the directory is 0777-0002=0775
And the default value for permissions of the file is 0666-0002=0664

We can change the desired value of umask by executing
umask 0022

If we use lsattr, we will notice that there are many dashes in the folders.
The output can be as follows:
--------------e-----    ./Desktop
--------------e-----    ./Public
--------------e-----    ./dir1
--------------e-----    ./Documents
...

sudo chattr +a user.txt

The +a means the append attribute is set.

Now no one not even root can change the contents of the file.

Another attribute is +A, which means no access time modification

Q) The root user runs the following command: chattr +i users.txt
Who will be able to remove or change the file?
Answer: Nobody, not even root

Processes 1
A running instance of a program is called a process and it runs in its own memory
space. Each time you execute a command, a new process starts.
A process Is an active entity as opposed to a program, which is considered to be a
passive entity.
A new process is created only when running an executable file (not when running Shell
builtin commands).
Process properties:
- PID (Process ID) - a unique positive integer number
- User
- Group
- Priority/Nice

If a shell built in file is created, there is no process created.
Only executing an executable file, will lead to creation of a process.

Processes 2

Type of Processes:
Parent
Child
Daemon
.Zombie (defunct)
Orphan

There are quite a few commands for checking process: 
ps 
pgrep 
pstree
top

These are the most common commands to check the processes. 

ps -e displays all processes that are running.

ps -f is for status information.

ps -ef displays all processes with detailed information.

Daemons are the processes that run in the background and are non-interactive.

To sort the list of processes based on their memory usage, 
ps aux --sort=%mem | less

To sort in descending order,
ps aux --sort=-%mem | less

If we want to see the processes of a specific user, use the -u option
ps -f -u student

Now if we execute ps -ef | grep xyz123,
there is a process created one of grep and other of ps, which then outputs us one,
which may look strange at first but it is our process only.

There is one command pgrep, which searches for the name of the process and then outputs the process id.

pgrep -l sshd

This displays both the process id as well as the name of the process.

To tweak the refresh rate of top, we can type d, then we can input values even less than 1.
To see the jobs of a particular user, we can use the option u, where we can specify the user
To tweak the fields, we can press the f key, wherein to select a particular field, we can type the
space key and this selects the field.

To move the field up or down, we can select the field using the right arrow key, and then move the field up or down, based on our preference.
When done, we can press escape and then we can see that the changes are reflected.

To write the configuration such that the next time we come across the same setting we had before, press w for write.

top -d 1 -n 3 -b > top_processes.txt

This writes 3 iterations of the command to the text file.

If we use the kill -l command, it lists the different types of kill commands, that exist in linux
To get the process id of a specific process, we can use the pgrep command,

To send an interrupt signal, -2 is for SIGINT command to the process.

To kill the process with the interrupt, we can use the kill -2 14804

Another way of getting all the process ids of the processes is using the pidof command
pidof firefox

Output is somewhat 15029 14977 14960 14924 14871

To kill the process with multiple pids, we can use the same command
kill -INT 15029 14977 14960 14924 14871

We can also use the -INT command instead of the -2 option

To avoid always copying the process ids of the processes, we can use the following use case
kill -SIGINT $(pidof firefox)

Another useful process the is the HUP which is used to reload a process.

We can reload the process by sudo kill -1 701

If we pass in the term signal, there are three things that can take place:
1) Process stops immediately
2) Process stops with a little bit delay
3) Process works indefinitely and ignores the term signal.

The process can choose what to make out of the term signal

sleep delays the execution for a certain amount of time.

We can use the sleep command as
sleep 311&

We can then see all the sleep process by pgrep -l sleep

killall -15 sleep

The -15 is the option for terminate command

pkill slee
The pkill command can run by partial names as well.

We can add a background job by adding an ampersand at the end.

sleep 20 &

When the process is running in the background, we dont have to wait for the process to end at all 
to execute another one.

nohub ifconfig &

This executes the command in the background and then writes its output in the nohup.out
